# Retain - A spaced repetition online learning platform
![Retain Logo](https://github.com/aali195/retain/blob/master/retain/static/img/logo_tr_small.png)

## Introduction
Created with extension support in mind, this is a project that I worked on for my final undergraduate year to help me get the hang of different web development technologies. As a fan of spaced repetition learning but as someone who is generally lazy, I decided to build a platform that allows for forcing the user to stick to revising what they learn and this is the outcome. 

Will be deployed soon.
